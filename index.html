							<p>I am a Mechanical Engineer specializing in prototyping, design, manufacturing, and fabrication. My current position has afforded me the opportunity to learn many different skills under the mechanical engineering field that can be put to use in a variety of environments. 
								I have experience taking products from conceptualization, through design, prototyping, refinement, and manufacturing. I have no doubt that I could be an asset to any company that would allow me the opportunity to put my skills on display.</p>
							<br>
							<p>I graduated with a B.S. from San Jose State University</p>
							<br>
							<p>Below you can find an overview of some past projects, chosen to showcase my abilities.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Modified Robot Arm</h2>
										<p>For this project, the client designed an addition to their UR-10 robot, consisting of meshing gears that would lock together, and disengage via linear slides. Unfortunately they did not design this for machinibilty, and therefore could not get any standard machine shops to take on the project. 
											With seemingly impossible to achieve tolerances, and 20+ hour run times on some parts, the project was one that truly gave me a few weeks of headaches. The main issue was due to tight tolerances between the slot features in the back of the steel gear, and the protrusions of the aluminum housing. 
											The gear had to be nearly perfectly even on all 7 of its sliding slot surfaces, and the housing needed to match on its 7 protruding slides. Once matched, the gear needed to be able to slide up and down with with zero hangups, the slightest of which would cause the mechanism to bind and not engage.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Silicone Diaphragm Mold</h2>
										<p>This silicone diaphram was to be inserted into a device that could spray a fluid into the users mouth. For this I had to design the mold and insert, then CAM and cut both. The shape was interesting but not too difficult to fabricate using the 5-axis cnc.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Intravenous Stent</h2>
										<p>For this project, the client was having trouble getting other shops to manufacture this stent. They continuously received products that had some integral feature comprised, i.e slot depth or edge straightness. Along with this, there could be no microscopic burrs, 
											as this was to be precisely inserted into a patients body. This project required designing a fixture that could properly hold these parts as well as CAMing and machining the fixture, and then the parts in 5-Axis. This was especially difficult due to their size, as each part was only 0.065 inches in diameter</p>

											<h3 class="major">Wiring setup</h3>
											<p>This project was a great test of wiring, soldering, and ee skills. It involved determining how to safely setup industrial LEDs that the client could easily move between locations. It had to be safe (AC current concerns), mobile, and plug and play for multiple LED outputs. Finally, heat management was a consern that had to be addressed and resolved to protect all components in the system from damage.</p>
